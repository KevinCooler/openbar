# openbar

Openbar is a customer facing point of sale application for bars. We intend to change the bar experience in the same way that Uber changed the experience of ordering and paying for a taxi. Instead of having to push through a crowd of people to gain the attention of a busy bartender or waiting because you forgot to pay your tab, Open bar provides the ability to order and pay for a drink from anywhere. 

Run the application through the OpenbarCLI class.
