# openbar

Openbar is a customer facing point of sale application for bars. We intend to change the bar experience in the same way that Uber changed the experience of ordering and paying for a taxi. Instead of having to push through a crowd of people to gain the attention of a busy bartender or waiting because you forgot to pay your tab, Open bar provides the ability to order and pay for a drink from anywhere. 

Application is in the process of being converted from a CLI view to a web view.
